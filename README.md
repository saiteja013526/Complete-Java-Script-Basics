# Complete-Java-Script-Basics

"You can refer to this repository to gain a basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
I won't say you'll become a master in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, but you will learn how things work in JavaScript.
This includes various methods for working with strings, arrays, variables, and objects, among other concepts.
Additionally, the repository covers some advanced topics, explained simply with small examples,
to help you understand these concepts more easily."

I have also created a simple version of the rock-paper-scissors game using HTML and JavaScript. If any beginner like me wants to make it more interactive, they can pull the code and make it more interactive and ping me on the github so that I can also learn more and more.
Until then, keep coding and keep practising..........
